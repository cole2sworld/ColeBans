=ColeBans=
==A simple ban plugin that puts YOU in control.==

===Want to convert from a YAML file to JSON? No problem. Want to move from MCBans to a local MySQL database? Simple. Want to use a new format we don't have support for? Write a custom ban handler, or request it.===


The point of ColeBans is to provide a extensible, simple, and useful plugin for bans. Most of the plugins I have seen are all rigid, or use their own service/configuration without an ability to change.


ColeBans is made for CraftBukkit 1818 at the time of writing.

The Jenkins for this plugin and all other Cole2's World plugins can be found [http://ci.cole2sworld.com:8080 here].
